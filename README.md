# Harness Deploy Action

## Description

Call the [Harness.io](https://harness.io/) API to deploy an application.

## Usage

```yaml
   - name: Deploy
     id: deploy
     uses: fac/harness-deploy-action@v1
     with:
       webhookUrl: ${{ secrets.HARNESS_WEBHOOK_URL }}
       application: XYZ12345678ABC
       services: web,console,job
       version: ${{ github.sha }}

   - name: Deploy Link
     run: |
       echo harness_url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.harness_url }}
```

## Package for distribution

GitHub Actions will run the entry point from the action.yml. Packaging assembles the code into one file that can be checked in to Git, enabling fast and reliable execution and preventing the need to check in node_modules.

Actions are run from GitHub repos.  Packaging the action will create a packaged action in the dist folder.

Run prepare

```bash
npm run prepare
```

Since the packaged index.js is run from the dist folder.

After pushing to GitHub, an Action running on this repo will check if the `dist/` folder is up to date for you, and warn if it's not.

```bash
git add dist
```

## Run tests

Run tests using

```bash
npm run test
````

Tests are also run in an action on GitHub.

## Inputs

### webhookUrl

The full webhook url for harness, including the authentication token. Add the
URL as an Actions secret on your repo, and pass it to the action.

The value needs to be the complete URL (include `https://`), the action will
make a request using it as it, with a payload built from the other inputs.

For this you need to a [Harness webhook trigger](https://docs.harness.io/article/ys3cvwm5gc-trigger-a-deployment-on-git-event)
setup with a custom payload. Go to *Setup >> App Name >> Triggers* in the UI,
you can add a trigger if you don't have one. Click *Manual Trigger* on the one
you want to use and copy the Webhook URL from the top of the dialog that opens.

### application

String id of the application to deploy. You can get this from harness, by going
to *Setup >> App Name* and then copying from the url, path segment after `app/`.

### services

String, comma separated list of services to deploy.

### version

String version to deploy.

## Outputs

### harness_url

The harness url to watch the deploy on. Note that this contains the application
id.

### error
